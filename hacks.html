      <h2>TURN YOUR PEANUT BUTTER UPSIDE DOWN</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/peanut-butter.jpeg" alt="peanut butter" />
      <p>
        This is so simple, but once you make this easy switch, you'll never look
        back. Turn your jar of peanut butter upside down. That's it. Natural
        peanut butter – and other nut butters – don't have any added
        stabilisers, so the oils will usually separate and move to the top of
        the jar. Save yourself the time and faff (and mess) of trying to stir it
        together, and just store it upside down. The oils will head to the
        bottom of the jar, making it much easier to use when the time comes.
        Happy nut butter spreading and spooning.

      <h2>USE OVERRIPE BANANAS FOR THE BEST BANANA BREAD</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/banana-bread.jpeg" alt="Banana bread" />
      <p>
        If you do end up with black or brown bananas, fear not. Overripe bananas
        are best for use in baking as they're sweeter and easier to mash into
        batter. Banana bread is a favourite for using the fruit – this version
        also incorporates cocoa nibs and a shot of coffee.

      <p>
        For those who would prefer to skip the arm workout that comes with
        mashing potatoes, using an electric hand mixer is an easy solution. As
        well as taking away all the effort, a hand mixer ensures lump-free mash
        every time.

      <h2>MICROWAVE PIZZA WITH WATER</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/pizza.jpeg" alt="pizza" />
      <p>
        Revive leftover, dried-out pizza by microwaving it with a mug of water.
        As the water evaporates, moisture fills the microwave, rehydrating the
        dry crust and giving you a gooey, cheesy pizza slice once more.

      <h2>GRATE BUTTER FOR EASY SPREADING</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/butter.jpeg" alt="butter" />
      <p>
        If you’re having a hard time with cold butter, use a grater to soften
        the perfect amount to put on toast or bread. It'll make the butter
        easier to spread, without destroying your loaf in the process. This
        method is even used by chefs to make perfect buttery pastry.

      <h2>USE VEGETABLE WATER IN GRAVY</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/vegetable-broth.jpeg" alt="vegetable broth" />
      <p>
        You might already use the juices from roasted meat in your gravy, but
        don't forget about veggies. Add the nutrient-rich water from boiled veg
        and any run-off from a roasting tin as well. It'll make for a flavourful
        gravy packed with vitamins.

      <h2>MASSAGE KALE</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/kale.jpeg" alt="kale" />
      <p>
        If you're planning on eating raw kale in a salad, massage the greens
        beforehand. It may sound odd but it'll tenderise the hardy leaves.
        First, remove the stem and add a glug of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon
        and a pinch of salt to the leaves. Then gently knead the kale with your
        hands until the leaves start to wilt a little. Be careful not to
        overwork the greens though as they'll become mushy.

      <h2>REVIVE OLD BREAD WITH WATER</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/bread.jpeg" alt="bread" />
      <p>
        Sprinkle a few tablespoons of water over bread that's a few days old,
        then stick it in a hot oven for a few minutes. It'll bring your stale
        loaf back to life. This trick works best on whole, unsliced loaves like
        baguettes, sourdough or ciabatta.

      <h2>STORE HEARBS LIKE FLOWERS</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/herbs.jpeg" alt="herbs" />
      <p>
        Want to know the secret for making cut herbs last? Keep them upright in
        about 5cm (2 inches) of water as you would a bunch of flowers. Shelter
        them from direct sunlight and change the water regularly. They'll stay
        fresher for longer.

      <h2>KEEP COFFEE COOL AND CAFFEINATED</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/coffee.jpeg" alt="coffee" />
      <p>
        This tip is essential for iced coffee lovers who don't want their
        caffeine hit watered down. Brew fresh coffee (as strong as you like it)
        and pour it into an ice cube tray. Add the frozen coffee cubes to cold
        brew or iced coffee, or blend them with milk to make an iced latte.

      <h2>MICROWAVE LEMONS TO GET MORE JUICE</h2>
      <img src="./assets/Images/lemons.jpeg" alt="lemons" />
      <p>
        Get more juice from a lemon by microwaving it on high for around 20
        seconds. It'll be warmer and softer than straight from the fridge,
        making the citrus fruit easier to squeeze. It's a must-try hack if
        you're making lemonade too.
